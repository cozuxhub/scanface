# scanface

Note: These codes are for calling other currently used tools without opening different terminals in the Linux terminal.
In penetration tests, it performs "basic" scans on a single terminal to solve the puzzles of vulnerable machines that we can find on some sites.

## installation and use
First, let's download it to our Linux terminal: `git clone https://github.com/cozuxhub/scanface.git` <br>
Go to the directory where you installed the folder and enter the folder. <br> 
Then run the application: `python3 scanface.py` <br>

It will ask you for the IP address of the target, in which folder and under what name the nMap scan output will be saved, and whether a directory scan will be performed again after scanning the web server. Once you enter the required information, the transactions will become automatic. Enjoy you!
